# ProtoCentral tinyECG MAX30001G ECG & Respiration monitoring module

ProtoCentral tinyECG MAX30001G ECG & Respiration monitoring module is a tiny module based on the Analog Devices MAX30001 ECG and Respiration sensor. It is a single lead ECG and Respiration sensor with a built-in amplifier, front-end and ADC. It can be used to measure ECG and Respiration signals from the human body. 

The form factor of the module is designed to fit the [Adafruit QT Py](https://www.adafruit.com/category/595) or[Seeed Studio XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/) series of microcontroller boards. These boards offers a tiny form factor with a built-in USB port and a battery connector and are based on your choice of a multitude of microcontrollers . Coupled with one of these boards, you can build a tiny wearable ECG and Respiration monitoring device.
